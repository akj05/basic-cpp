ðŸ’» "HELLO-WORLD" & "SIMPLE CALCULATOR"

ðŸŽ¯ Aim

a) To display "Hello World" on the console.
b) To develop a basic calculator for arithmetic operations.

ðŸ“˜ Theory
Part a: Displaying "Hello World" on the Console
The "Hello World" program is considered the simplest and most essential example when beginning to learn a new programming language. It allows the programmer to understand the basic structure and syntax of the language, as well as how to display output on the screen. By writing and executing this program, learners become familiar with the process of compiling or interpreting code, depending on the language being used. This exercise ensures that the programming environment is correctly set up and helps build confidence in writing and executing basic code.

Part b: Developing a Basic Calculator for Arithmetic Operations
Creating a basic calculator is a common beginner-level programming task that introduces the user to handling input and performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This program typically accepts two numerical inputs and an operator from the user and performs the corresponding calculation. Through this exercise, learners gain practical experience in using variables, operators, and conditional statements. It also enhances understanding of how to control the flow of a program and how to display the result of a computation, thus forming a foundation for more complex programming tasks in the future.

âœ… Conclusion
The experiment was successfully conducted in two parts. In the first part, the "Hello World" program was executed to understand the basic structure and output mechanism of the programming language. It confirmed that the development environment was properly set up and functioning. In the second part, a basic calculator was developed to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input. This part of the experiment enhanced the understanding of variables, input/output handling, and decision-making through conditional statements. Overall, the activity helped in building a strong foundation in basic programming concepts and logical thinking.
